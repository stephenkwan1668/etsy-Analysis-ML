# Etsy shops - Analysis + ML
E-commerce has revolutionized the way artisans and hobbyists can monetize their creativity, with platforms like Etsy providing a prime example of this digital transformation. As an online marketplace for handcrafted and vintage items, Etsy boasted over 7.47 million active sellers in 2022 (Statista, 2022). Despite its accessibility and popularity, the dynamics of running a successful Etsy shop remain under-explored. This research aims to fill this gap by delving into the complex interaction of factors such as customer reviews, delivery options, payment methods, among others, all of which significantly affect an online shop's performance (Mofokeng, 2021; Vasić, Kilibarda, & Kaurin, 2019).
To better understand these variables and their influence on customer behavior and buying patterns, this study will dissect key performance indicators from a rich dataset, "1M+ Etsy Shops Sales Data," covering the top 10,000 Etsy shops. Factors like shop ratings, favorites count, product listings, payment methods, average rating, customization options, and shop age will be analyzed to unveil their role in determining a shop's sales performance. This information is invaluable, providing a robust foundation for shop owners to optimize their strategies and enhance sales outcomes.
Furthermore, our research does not stop at mere analysis but extends into the field of machine learning. We will employ models such as the Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor to predict sales performance based on the factors identified. The predictive and analytical capabilities of these machine learning techniques have demonstrated potential in e-commerce sales prediction (Cheriyan et al., 2018), and can guide strategic decision-making and forecast-driven planning. By combining empirical analysis with machine learning, this study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanics driving sales performance in online marketplaces like Etsy.
